# BC2407-Project
In this project, we analysed police misconduct in the United States of America.

Using data from police databases and Kaggle, we used logisitic regression, multivariate adaptive regression spline, along with studies done by expert to do a root cause analysis, giving our recommendations in the process.

Finally, we created a prediction model to identify high-risk police officers, using classification and regression tree as well as random forest as our main models. We managed a model of over 85% accuracy, and gave recommendations to reduce police misconducts in the future.

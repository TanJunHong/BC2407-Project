# BC2407 Project
In this project, we analysed police misconduct in the United States of America.

Using data from police databases and Kaggle, we used logisitic regression, multivariate adaptive regression spline, along with studies done by experts to identify the root causes of police misconduct.

Finally, we created a prediction model to identify high-risk police officers, using classification and regression tree as well as random forest as our main models. We managed to build a model with over 85% accuracy, and gave recommendations to reduce police misconducts in the future.

# BC2407 Project
In this project, we analysed police misconduct in the United States of America.

Using data from police databases and Kaggle, we used logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression spline, along with studies done by experts to identify the root causes of police misconduct.

Then, we created a prediction model to identify high-risk police officers, using classification and regression tree as well as random forest as our main models. We managed to build a model with over 85% accuracy and gave recommendations to reduce police misconducts in the future.

Finally, we made use of PowerBI to create a visualisation of our data and Shiny in R to create an interface for our prediction model. The respective files can be found in the root folder of this repository.
